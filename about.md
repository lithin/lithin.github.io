Hello! My name is Anna, and I'm a front-end developer living and working in London.

Although I spend most of my time working for [Time Out](http://www.timeout.com/london), developing apps for personalised content and search, I also work on my own projects. These aren't usually driven not by need or profit but by my passion to try new things and love for learning.

I'm interested in developing dynamic apps with javascript. I love trying new technologies that might not have big support yet but hopefully will one day make it to the mainstream.

I also believe that cool design and great performance are equally important and I'm always trying to find ways how to improve load time and user interaction with the website.
